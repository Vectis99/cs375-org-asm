Lab 4 Miscellany

1. You must have a newline after an .include "something.asm" statement (press
enter after the line). Otherwise, you will get build errors.

2. In order to get enough power to the LCD, the power jumper on the
programmer must be set to 5V.

3. To the left of the LCD, near the reset button, there is a
potentiometer which controls the LCD's brightness.  If you aren't seeing
anything on the display and you have the power set correctly, try adjusting
this potentiometer.
