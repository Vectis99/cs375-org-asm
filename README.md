## About

This repository serves as an archive of my coursework for the Oregon State University course "Computer Organization and Assembly Language". It covers topics ranging from general assembly language instructions to interrupt vectors, UART, and register management, as examples.

This software runs on a general purpose Oregon State University educational PCB equipped with an [ATMega128](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATMEGA128) processor.
